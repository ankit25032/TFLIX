The film's music was composed by Anu Malik, and the lyrics by Sameer. Reduced to a henpecked husband, his dream of making it big and being independent in the USA, Dr. Anmol Acharya is, in short, disillusioned and sad. He is not alone, he has his father-in-law, Manilal in the same leaky boat with him. Then this family has a new neighbor, namely Gulu Gulab Khatri. They find out that he a crime lord from India, and has a price-tag of two crore rupees on his head. Anmol and Manilal's wife want their respective husbands to go to India and arrange to hand-over Khatri, so they can collect the dough. Anmol and Manilal do go to India, but things don't go well as planned, and the hapless duo end up as hostages by Chota Chatri and Yeda Anna, who have orders to kill Khatri, and anyone else who gets in their way."

She moves in with him and his family, which includes his brother, Niranjan (Ramesh Deo), his sister-in-law, Jaswanti (Shashikala), their three children, and Deepak's father (Jagirdar). That leaves the humiliated Prakash determined to get Aarti back, whatever he may have to do.

The film's music was composed by Anu Malik, and the lyrics by Sameer. Reduced to a henpecked husband, his dream of making it big and being independent in the USA, Dr. Anmol Acharya is, in short, disillusioned and sad. He is not alone, he has his father-in-law, Manilal in the same leaky boat with him. Then this family has a new neighbor, namely Gulu Gulab Khatri. They find out that he a crime lord from India, and has a price-tag of two crore rupees on his head. Anmol and Manilal's wife want their respective husbands to go to India and arrange to hand-over Khatri, so they can collect the dough. Anmol and Manilal do go to India, but things don't go well as planned, and the hapless duo end up as hostages by Chota Chatri and Yeda Anna, who have orders to kill Khatri, and anyone else who gets in their way."

The only obstacle is that Pooja's dad is wealthy and the Chief Minister of the state, while Vijay's background is lower middle-class. Humiliated by Tiwari, Vijay marries advocate Kiran, and together they give birth to a daughter named Bobby. Kiran represents a number of defendants who are charged by the police, and is always on hand to secure their release, and this causes some acrimony in their marriage. Then an unmarried Pooja re-enters Vijay's life, and this time she intends to stay close to this family. Tragedy strikes the Saxena family when Kiran is killed by assailants. With the police having no clues as to who her killers are, Vijay takes it upon himself to bring the culprits to justice. It is then he finds out that Bobby has been kidnapped, and the only way he can save her is by turning himself in to her kidnappers."

And the other is Rudra, a poor laborer employed by Avadh, who wants justice when he finds out that his nine year old daughter, Durga, has been beaten and brutally raped by Avadh's sons, Bachhu, and Bhola. Amidst this background we have a corrupt doctor, who is willing to change his medical report after he is bribed appropriately; and a Police Inspector, Ramnarayan Bhardwaj, who is willing to drop any charges against Avadh's sons provided he gets his 'dues' from the Thakur."

However, the plan goes awry, and he finds himself deep in debt to two of his partners, gangster Sikander (Gulshan Grover) and hitman Kaif (Kay Kay Menon).

He casually makes inquiries about Chanda and her father, and finds out that Harihar passed away long ago; Chanda got pregnant and was hastily married to a aged and invalid man, gave birth to a baby girl, subsequently became insane, and died. He also finds out that Chanda sent her daughter, Kajli, away to another town to study and become a doctor. Amarnath is shocked and full of guilt at the injustice and anguish he has caused Chanda and her family. Then he gets to meet Kajli, who is not studying medicine - but earning her living in a brothel - as a foul-mouthed prostitute."

His only clues: a series of victims whose necks bear the distinctive mark of strangulation by barbed wire. Fighting to avenge as well as to survive, Casey must sharpen his razor-like responses and take his battle skills to the next level, even using deep meditation to fake his own death. His target: the sinister drug lord Goro, who is flooding the streets with deadly meth cooked at his remote jungle factory. To prepare for his ultimate confrontation, Casey must finally become an invisible warrior worthy of the name Ninja. But just when his prey is cornered, an unexpected twist shows Casey that his battle is only beginning: he truly can trust no one."

The summer now unfolds more dramatically as the boys make detrimental choices—of love, sex, friendship, jealousy, heartbreaks & betrayal, finally leading to broken bonds of friendship. The film travels with Siddharth as he explores equations with his past—to rebuild friendships with his four friends whom he grew up with in a small town in Himachal Pradesh in India. When Siddharth lands in India from the US, ghosts from his youth loom up. He finally overcomes the complications and sets right all the wrongs done in his past & rediscovers bonds of friendship.I n the end Siddharth goes back to New York a better man; reconciled with his past & most importantly rediscovering a happier today. He returns to New York with the belief that friendship is indeed like Purani Jeans, the older the better!!"

And a few yet, get in so deep at the wrong end of paradise, that they are lost forever, in the same place, but in a whole different world altogether. The film takes one such real-life character - Roy - through a plethora of happenings, phenomena, legends, myths, sights, sounds, experiences and thrilling stories of the fabled Goan paradise. What happens to the protagonist through the bitter-sweet, darkly funny, crazy, trippy journey and what comes along at the end of it, weaves the half-fictitious/half-real story of our film - CandyFlip."

The person behind the said page, Mona happens to be missing. Her friend, and a fellow student, Sarah recruits the help of a classmate, Wiki - a borderline sociopathic genius. This odd-couple of amateur sleuths carry on their investigation as the story leads them into unexpected corners and terrifying revelations. It's a pacy thriller, confined to limited locations on one single campus, populated by fresh, sexy, young characters that can be executed on a fairly shoestring budget. More importantly it captures the present zeitgeist of young India and its obsession with social networking."

Who in turn has devious plans for the child's 12th birthday which happens to fall on a leap year. The same building 20 years later becomes home to a brothel, where a young unexploited concubine is dealing with her self-proclaimed 'first' client who has a strange inability to fulfil his physical desire unless obligated to the duress of a transaction to do so. Now, 30 years later these same walls surround a sublime home which belongs to a soul-stirring 75 year old couple who love, laugh and dance together. They whisper the secrets of time forgone and seemed to have overcome the undying need for love and escape which seems to have plagued the inhabitants of this house in the past."

            "overview":"A brooding, alcoholic police officer with a painful past is sent, against his will, to a government guest house high up in the icy cold, mountains of Himachal Pradesh to investigate the death of a 17 year old girl. The case, reported as a wolf attack, turns out to be a murder. The girl was shot in the head before being eaten by the wolves. All 5 inhabitants of the resoprt are suspects, with each one having an alibi. To the horror of Daljeet, the police officer, this also happens to be a dry resort without any access to alcohol for miles all around. As the the layers of the story start to unravel, the officer has to fight his own frail health and withdrawal from alcohol addiction to find the murderer before it is too late. The only sliver of hope is the one single witness- the murdered girl herself."
